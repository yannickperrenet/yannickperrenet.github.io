Hi üëã, thanks for visiting.

My name is Yannick and I'm a software engineer. In my free time I like to tinker behind my computer
working on [my open source projects](/projects) or trying to climb a challenging boulder in the
climbing gym. Lately, I've been enjoying myself trying to solve competitive programming problems on
[Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/problemset).

I'm currently living in the beautiful city of Nijmegen in The Netherlands. Moving to Nijmegen
coincidentally marked the end of my journey at [Orchest](https://github.com/orchest/orchest) (a
workflow scheduler like Apache Airflow). We'd been building Orchest and offering it as a managed
cloud service for three years before deciding to give back the remaining $2M of the $4.15M we raised
from our investors (Gradient Ventures, Basis Set Ventures, Seedcamp, Script Capital, Data Community
Fund and angels like Anthony Goldbloom). It was an amazing three years filled with tons of
learnings, but as the market had become too
[commoditized](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/06/12/strategy-letter-v/) in our opinion we
didn't see a way forward.

Now that I'm no longer working on Orchest, feel free to reach out to me through [my
LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yannickperrenet) if you'd like to work with me.
