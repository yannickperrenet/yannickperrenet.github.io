[The video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ-J91SwP8w) was written and narrated by [Richard Heinberg](https://richardheinberg.com/about) who, among a list of other things, received the Atlas Award for climate heroes in 2012 and the M. King Hubbert Award for Excellence in Energy Education in 2006.

To me it is an excellent video containing many valuable messages. Below I want to highlight particular phrases (in italic), add to them additional arguments and convey some of my own thoughts (in the form of a bullet list).

*Great depression due to overproduction. Advertisers invent consumerism to soak up overproduction.*

-   Advertising leads to enshittification to the core of businesses.

    Advertisers provide a steady income to many businesses such as the media. Thereby, they indirectly get a vote in the decisions of those businesses as without the advertisers money the businesses would lose to their competitors (e.g. due to lower prices).

    For the media this results in media firms favoring entertainment over their core business of journalism. Media sells a product (readers and audiences) to other businesses (advertisers). And nothing yields readers better than entertainment whilst keeping the advertisers happy (i.e. no controversial news stories that might go against their interests).[^2]

-   "Real men eat meat"

    Without a doubt great marketing as this slogan is ingrained in western culture: "I can't do without my piece of meat", "Real men know how to BBQ", etc. However, apart from being a great way to sell a mass-produced product, i.e. meat, it provides little value (as humans don't particularly need a lot of meat) but has devastating effects for the environment and climate.[^4]

-   We buy lots of products we don't actually need.

    The production requires precious fossil fuels, other non-renewable resources and produces unwanted by-products such as toxic chemicals that are dumped into nature. Not to talk about the products themselves becoming waste[^8].

    As an example, in 2024 VPRO released a documentary called "Food for Thought" that shows, among other things, how the United Arab Emirates keeps Dutch milk cows in the desert. Of course these cows can't survive in the desert climate thus they live in a 24/7 air-conditioned space, which costs precious water (it is in the desert after all), and lots of it! Why not buy another drink instead?


*Advertisers use television to hook new generations of consumers*

-   Usefulness is no longer the key metric to judge products by, appeal is.

    Generally speaking, marketing bypasses the premise of capitalism where buyers and sellers ought to be well informed to engage in transactions of mutual self-interest. Claims are no longer made in language and thereby sellers can sell something other than the factual truth (i.e. they sell an emotional appeal).

    For example, which TV commercial is based on facts? Instead commercials try to convey messages such as "only successful people buy this product", making you think "if I buy, then I'm successful". Well said by Neil Postman in his book[^3]:

    > No claims are made, except those the viewer projects onto or infers from the commercial.

-   Daily news is funded partially through advertisement (and government subsidies)[^6] and thus becomes another medium for entertainment. Without excellent news stories people can't properly inform their (political) choices which causes a variety of issues.

    News stories don't have any implications.

    Through the "Now ... this" mode of discourse news is stripped of its context, consequences and (essential) seriousness. There is no room to think about what was just said as the next clip is already presented.

    > 21 percent of television viewers could not recall any news items within one hour of broadcast[^7].

    Without thinking about the news, one can not think about its implications. Without implications news holds no meaning for one's life (other than to entertain).


*Everyone is shocked how dependent they are on oil. [..] Everyone forgets energy shortages.*

-   Oil is estimated to run out in 25 years at the current rates of production[^9].

    In addition, burning all of the oil we have would greatly exceed emissions targets averting climate catastrophe. Not to mention our dependency on fossil fuels to power the energy transition to renewables.

-   The most important renewable energy (RE) sources, wind and solar energy, are intermittent, necessitating major energy storage. Moreover, technical limits arise from the physics of conversion processes and other inefficiencies making these sources unlikely to power the future[^10].

    I highly recommend reading "Energy and Human Ambitions on a Finite Planet" by Thomas W. Murphy[^11] to understand the physics behind these predictions. He clearly explains why different energy sources will have difficulty replacing fossil fuels and shares his thoughts on why even having infinite energy is unlikely to save the human race (e.g. the by-product of warmth will lead to significant global warming).

*Market vs planned economies. Market wins. "The market will solve everything."*

-   This is a whole topic in and of itself. As its the unpopular opinion, I'll share an argument why a planned economy might not be so bad after all.

    -   Large companies are internally managed as planned economies (e.g. Walmart) so why wouldn't it work for the national economy.

        As an example, showing market economies don't work for companies, when the company Sears was taken over by a hedge fund in 2004, the new leadership took a drastically different approach and made every division its own autonomous business (seeking market dynamics within the company). This led to the multi-billion dollar company filing for bankruptcy in 2018.[^12]

-   The market makes companies more obsessed with continuous growth than with providing useful products.

    As Ed Zitron puts it[^14]:

    > Our economy isn't one that produces things to be used, but things that increase usage.

    Big tech is a great example of this, they try to hook you on their (free) apps to sell your data to advertisers. Bringing about other topics of discussion such as privacy, escapism, polarization and others.


*Globalization.*

-   Just because its cheaper it is produced elsewhere.

    For example, cod is caught in Norway, frozen, transported to China, unfrozen, cut into pieces, frozen, transported back to be sold in Europe[^13].

-   We are heavily dependent on other nations.

    This doesn't have to be a bad thing of course. But why eat fruit that comes from Latin America if you might as well eat fruit that is grown locally. The latter significantly reduces the environmental footprint.

    Same goes for dependencies in our daily lives. We often don't own the products we pay for, e.g. software that is sold as a monthly subscription model, and we certainly don't know how to fix our products.

-   Globalization is here to stay according to our world leaders.

    Take for example Ursula von der Leyen (President of the European Commission) who, during her keynote speech at the World Economic Forum in 2025[^20], advocates for less economic borders between European nations in order to "stay in the race" in terms of innovation and economic growth.


*China burns half of the world's coal.*

-   Due to Russia sanctions Germany (and other nations) are using coal again as an important energy source[^15].

    Nevertheless, these nations are indirectly still importing Russian gas and oil (although in part "unknowingly")[^16]. Furthermore, as explained in the documentary by Zembla, these Russian oil tankers are uninsured and are still crossing international waters (since there are no laws to prevent this). In the long term this will likely cause environmental disasters due to oil leakage.


*Fossil fuels to power growth.*

-   Everything (think growth, prosperity and progress) is powered by fossil fuels.

    For example, in 2023 in the USA, fossil fuels were responsible for more than 80% of total energy consumption.[^18] The prosperity we know today comes from the usage of fossil fuels in the past as the upshot in global wealth clearly coincides with our heavy reliance on fossil fuels.[^11]

    Oil is such an important resource that nations will go to war over it, e.g. many claim that the USA invaded Iraq not to destroy weapons of mass destruction, but to export their precious oil[^17].

-   Our current economy is build on growth.

    How else can one expect interest on loans.


*Rising CO2 levels lead to heat waves.*

-   [The Paris agreement](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement) mentions its overarching goal is to hold "the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels" and pursue efforts "to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels."

    Sadly, as mentioned by the United Nations, "The first 12-month period to exceed 1.5°C as an average was February 2023 - January 2024"[^19] which is an indication that the goal to stay below 2°C is in jeopardy as well.


*Topsoil erodes*

-   Chemours, Tata Steel and other toxic-producing (directly or as a by-product) companies pollute local drinking water, soil and the air we breath.

    PFAS and other forms of PFOA are highly toxic and cause serious health issues[^22]. Why do we pick the comfort of (toxic) non-stick coated pans over just using stainless steel pans?

-   Without healthy soil we can't grow food.

    In the documentary "Kiss the Ground" (2020) we learn about the positive impacts of regenerative agriculture. However, government subsidies cause farmers to use pesticides and other unnatural techniques that essentially kill their land in the long run.


*Species go extinct*

-   Not only is this a sad fact, but also a troubling one. The extinction of species can have detrimental effects on ecosystems and thereby, in the end, us.


*Oil companies drill in miles of sea water, because the easy oil is gone.*

-   As expressed in context of another highlight, oil spillage at a large scale is likely to happen again in the next few years due to uninsured Russian oil tankers.


*Manufacturing moves to polluting nations where labor is cheap.*

-   Problem shifting.

    To hit climate goals western nations simply shift the problem to poorer nations. That way they don't directly pollute and hit their climate targets.

    For example, they subsidize driving electric cars to reduce emission gases. However, cobalt and other resources that are needed for the batteries come from poor nations such as Congo. This destroys the local economies in Congo and pollutes the nation[^21]. Thus global pollution (although in another form) is the same, it is just shifted elsewhere.

    Colonialism already enriched rich countries over the backs of poorer ones by extracting resources and (forced) labor.


*But where are we headed? We can't continue like this. There are limits. [..] Learn to live without fossil fuels. [..] End of economic growth as we know it. [..] Live within natures budget of renewable resources. [..] RE are important but none can replace fossil fuels in the time we have. [..] **If we plan the transition, we can have a world that supports robust communities of healthy creative people and ecosystems with millions of other species.***

-   Absolutely banger ending! Love the optimism that it conveys whilst still addressing all that needs to be done.

    A good place to start is switching to a vegan diet and taking the bike more often.

    I assume many already know that for the mass production of meat animals are treated poorly, rainforests are deforested and greenhouse gas emissions are increased by over 10%. To put this into perspective, producing 100kcal of beef takes 1.600kcal of energy and 8.300kcal for lamb whereas for rice it takes just 48kcal[^5] (advocating for a dietary change, such as vegan). Why not feed those 8.300kcal directly to humans?

    In the documentary ["De PFAS-doofpot" by Zembla](https://www.bnnvara.nl/zembla/artikelen/de-pfas-doofpot) they talk about a secret study (which was kept secret to maintain the companies financial position) conducted by the chemical company Dupont (now Chemours) where they injected a group of chimpanzees with different levels of PFAS. Within 15 days every chimp, even the ones the lowest dose, had died.
